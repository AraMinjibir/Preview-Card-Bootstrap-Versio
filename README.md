# Preview-Card-Bootstrap-Version

# Project Description

This project was designed to showcase my skills in responsive design using the Bootstrap component framework.

The main container is named 'Container-fluid,' housing a grid-container (row) within it. Two columns are embedded within the grid container, spanning 6 columns from medium devices up to extra-extra-large screens (col-md-6).

The first column contains text, while the second column features a background image with an accent color.

Several attributes, not documented in Bootstrap, were customized using custom CSS. Additionally, some documented attributes were assigned to control their behavior. These include background colors (hsl(233, 47%, 7%), hsl(244, 38%, 16%), hsl(277, 64%, 61%)), background image, and colors (hsl(0, 0%, 100%)), such as slightly transparent white for the main paragraph (hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.75)) and for stat headings (hsla(0, 0%, 100%, 0.6)).

The font families used were 'Lexend Deca' and 'Inter,' with a font size of 15px and font weights of 600 and 400.

An image representing the expected outcome can be found in the 'images' folder.
